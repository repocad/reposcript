A textual language for programming designs
===
Rune is a programming language for designs. This library is written in [Scala](http://scala-lang.org).
This project includes lexing, parsing and evaluation. The evaluation step can be performed on any
surface which can draw arcs, bezier curves, lines and text. 
While the library is written in Scala it can be compiled to JavaScript via [ScalaJS](http://scala-js.org)
(as seen in [RepoCad](http://repocad.com)) or other platforms.

This software is in a very early stage. Use at your own risk.
